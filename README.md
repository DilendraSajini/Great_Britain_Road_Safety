In 2010, the United Nations Decade of Action for Road Safety was launched in order to reduce the rising trend in traffic deaths. The United Kingdom is one of the member countries with a road safety plan from 1999 to 2021, and the aim is to ensure that Britain remains a world leader in road safety. According to the actions taken by the government, the number of road deaths has been declining over the past few years and has a good record of reducing casualties. Therefore, motorcyclist, car driver, pedal cyclist, and pedestrian deaths have decreased over the years.

This research study will conduct <b> descriptive and inferential analysis </b> at many levels and show the success of the UK government's investment in road safety from 1999 to 2021 based on a data set from the Department of Transportation's traffic statistics. Additionally, <b>machine learning models</b> are supplied for assessing degrees of road fatality risk based on a variety of criteria. When the dataset is analysed, four levels of <b>causality risk classification (low risk, medium risk, high risk, and extremely high risk)</b> can be performed based on <b>road user type (pedestrian, pedal cycle, motorcycle, car, bus, coach, van, HGV, other vehicle)</b>, <b>gender (female, male)</b>, <b>area (urban or rural)</b>, and <b>road type (built-up road, non-built-up road, highway)</b>. As a conclusion, constant development should be necessary while increasing traffic and population trends in the future to ensure a safer environment on the road. With the foregoing research, the report identifies distinct priorities and areas for improvement.
